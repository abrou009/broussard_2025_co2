# CO2 Cross-Section Extrapolations at 195K and 300K

This repository gives the CO2 cross-section extrapolations used in Broussard et al. (2025). 

CO2_195K_least_conservative: provides the prescription for the least conservative CO2 cross sections at 195K. Column 1 is wavelength in nm, column 2 is the cross-section in cm^2. 

CO2_195K_most_conservative: provides the prescription for the most conservative CO2 cross sections at 195K. Column 1 is wavelength in nm, column 2 is the cross-section in cm^2. 

CO2_195K_recommended: provides the prescription for the recommended CO2 cross sections at 195K. Column 1 is wavelength in nm, column 2 is the cross-section in cm^2. 

CO2_300K_least_conservative: provides the prescription for the least conservative CO2 cross sections at 195K. Column 1 is wavelength in nm, column 2 is the cross-section in cm^2. 

CO2_300K_most_conservative: provides the prescription for the most conservative CO2 cross sections at 195K. Column 1 is wavelength in nm, column 2 is the cross-section in cm^2. 

CO2_300K_recommended: provides the prescription for the recommended CO2 cross sections at 195K. Column 1 is wavelength in nm, column 2 is the cross-section in cm^2.
